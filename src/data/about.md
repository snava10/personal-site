# Intro

I'm passionated about Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics and science in general. I'm an active contributor
to open source always looking for interesting projects to work on. My areas of experties are Microservices, Rest API's, Logging and Reporting, Testing, Information Retrieval and Web Development.
I have also touched on aspects of AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, Parsing and Compiling and Mobile App Development.


# Some history

- I was born and grew up in Cuba, with little to none access to computers or the internet, but I always liked Mathematics as a child and that was what eventually led me to pursue a Computer Science career.
- I attended a bording school in Havana from 2003 to 2006 where I met an incredibly talented group of people that to this day I consider my best friends. That period of my life was criucial to develop the academic discipline and competitivenes that would be so useful in later years.
- I graduated with honours from Havana University in 2013. My thesis title was: Estimation of scene flow based on the optical flow from multiple cameras. [link to download paper]
- I always liked the academic world and I pursued that path for a year, taking on a position as Teaching Assistant and Researcher at the Technological Institute in Havana. I tought Computer Programing to a class of 30 in the faculty of Electrical Engineering.
- Due to the harsh economic and political situation in Cuba I moved to the United Kingdom in 2015 where I got a job as a Software Engineer. I stablished myself in London, which I consider the best city in the world.
