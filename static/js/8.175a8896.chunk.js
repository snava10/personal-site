I'm an active contributor\nto open source always looking for interesting projects to work on. My areas of experties are Microservices, Rest API's, Logging and Reporting, Testing, Information Retrieval and Web Development.\nI have also touched on aspects of AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, Computer Vision, Parsing and Compiling and Mobile App Development.\n\n\n# Some history\n\n- I was born and grew up in Cuba, with little to none access to computers or the internet, but I always liked Mathematics as a child and that was what eventually led me to pursue a Computer Science career.\n- I attended a bording school in Havana from 2003 to 2006 where I met an incredibly talented group of people that to this day I consider my best friends. That period of my life was criucial to develop the academic discipline and competitivenes that would be so useful in later years.\n- I graduated with honours from Havana University in 2013. My thesis title was: Estimation of scene flow based on the optical flow from multiple cameras.

I tought Computer Programing to a class of 30 in the faculty of Electrical Engineering.\n- Due to the harsh economic and political situation in Cuba I moved to the United Kingdom in 2015 where I got a job as a Software Engineer. I stablished myself in London, which I consider to be the best city in the world.\n\n# I like\n\n- Reading\n- Working out\n- All sorts of sports, specially basketball and football\n- Playing guitar and listening to all sorts of music\n- Dancing\n- Astronomy and literally \"rocket science\"\n\n# I would like to\n\n- start a software company\n- open a bar with live music every night\n",d=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(o.b,Object(i.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Sergio Navarrete",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(r.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
